<h3 align="center">Find questions on Stack Overflow suited for you</h3>

Answerable is a Python program that learns from your answers in Stack Overflow and use them to find questions that you could answer.

It follows respectful crawling methods, like adding delays between calls and consulting the [`robots.txt`](https://stackoverflow.com/robots.txt) file of the site before any fetch.

**This project is still under development.**
