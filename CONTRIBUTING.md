# Contributing to Answerable

Thank you for thinking about contributing to this project! I hope you find Answerable useful and have some ideas to make it better.

In the [README.md](README.md) you will find the list of tasks I'm currently working on, in case you want to open a related issue or PR.

## Almost directly acceptable contributions

- Making grammar corrections anywhere in the documentation or the comments in the code (don't spam these).
- Fixing a bug. If you don't want or know how to fix it, you can still open an issue.
- Improving a piece of code without importing a new library. The less dependencies, the better.

## Contributions subject to review

- Modifying or extending the displayed statistics.
- Modifying or extending the recommendation algorithm.
- Extending the documentation.
- Solving any of the tasks listed in the To Do list in the [README.md](README.md)

## Contributions that require a heavy justification

- Replacing a working piece of code by an new import.
- Changes in the way data is displayed.
